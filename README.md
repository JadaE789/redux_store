  ## Project Description
  
  E-commerce website that allows user to shop for different categories of items. Users cannot buy what's in their cart until they log-in. If no account exists then they can sign-up and continue on to purchase their items. Users are also able to view ther order history.

  ## User Story
  
  AS a senior engineer working on an e-commerce platform
  I WANT my platform to use Redux to manage global state instead of the Context API
  SO THAT my website's state management is taken out of the React ecosystem

  ## Installation
  
  Redux, React.JS, MongoDB, Node.JS
